In the upper chart notice that on one hand India seems to struggle in treating wastewater but also shows drastic improvement in safely managing the waterwater. The lower two charts help us understand why! Observe the lower two charts carefully, India reduces open defecation but there is almost no increase in proportional treatment of wastewater. This is primarily because India conventionally has decentralized sanitation, meaning the absence of a centralized sanitary wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure. It ensures the reduction in open defecation essentially by having in-situ septic tanks which are not connected to a centralized underground wastewater network infrastructure.*")

United Nations has gloabally designed several Sustainable Developement Goals(SDGs) as actions to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure peace and prosperity for human beings. SDGs are the extensions of Millenium Developement Goals(MDGs), which were started in the year 2000 to serve the same purpose. SDG-6 is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This project analyzes overall developement of countries around the world, towards safely managing drinking water and sanitation. 

## Project Goals

This goals of this project are:
- To analyze different aspects and parameters that govern safety in drinking water and sanitation.
- To analyze developement in managing drinking water and sanitation in the worlds, over past 20 years.
- To isualize the population growth vs. developement over the period.


## Design

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?
- **Section 1 Growth in World Population over Time:** Population is an important and consistently growing parameter on which, developement largely depends. This section shows a pair of histograms depicting population growth in different countries and different SDG Regions in the the world between from the year 2000 to 2020. The color scheme is based on population of countries. **Hovering** the cursor on bars displays the Name, SDG Region and Population of a country. To visualize data for various years, instead of drop-down list or radio-buttons, we used **sliders** as it helps understand the changes over the years, smoothly and dynamically.
- **Section 2 Clean Water:** The data obtained has 10 different parameters. To visualize the correlation (connection) between these parameters, a correlation matrix is plotted. Many parameters show strong correlation among themselves. The SDG is to ensure clean drinking water, hence the most important parameter is 'Non Contaminated Water', which shows significantly high (80%) correlation with the 'Piped Water'. This indicates that as the piped water networks increase, the delivery of non-contaminated water increases.
- **Section 2.1 Classification of Drinking Water Infrastructure/ Methods:** From ancient ground/surface water withdrawl to modern pipe networks, methods of access to drinking water are developing continuously. The scatter plot in this section shows increase in population of different countries having access to safe/purified piped water through 20 years. The different dot sizes depict population of a country. As we hover over the graph, the **tooltip (cursor)** shows name of the country of a particular data point. **Single Selection** which acts as a dynamic query filter, enables user to click on any point and disaply its details on-demand in the form of a pie chart, alongside. The pie chart shows the accessability to Basic, Limited, Unimproved or Surface water in each country. This gives overall idea of the country's water infrastructure. 
- **Section 2.2 Performance by Nations in Delivering Non-contaminated, Safe Drinking Water to its Citizens:** As the goal of the SDG is to provide clean/safe drinking water to all, the scatter plots are created to show **World Population** vs. **Safely Managed Water**, **Non-Contaminated vs. Non-Piped Water**, and **Non-Contaminated vs. Piped Water**. The different dot sizes depict population of a country. The **Slider** of Years, help dynamically compare the progress of different nations over the time. For most of the countries, the parameters in all the three graphs show clear relation. Non-Contaminated water increases as the Safe management of water increases. Non-piped water increases/decreases, Non-contaminated water decreases/increases. Non-contaminated water increases as Pipe water increases.
- **Section 3 Sanitation:** Sanitatary waste-water systems have been a tremendously neglected infrastructure, especially in the developing and under-developed countries. The data obtained has 11 different parameters. To visualize the correlation (connection) between these parameters, a correlation matrix is plotted. A couple of parameters show strong correlation among themselves. The SDG is to ensure safe management of sanitary waste, hence the most important parameter is 'Safely Managed Sanitary SYstem', which shows significantly high (91%) correlation with the 'Sewer Connection'. This indicates that as the Connections to Sewer Networks increase, the Safe Management of Sewer Waste increases.
- **Section 3.1 Classification of Sewerage Infrastructure/ Methods:** Although Open-defecation is extremely unhygenic, a large number of world-population rely on it. However, the situation is slowly changing. Most of the countries have underground and safe sewer-systems on their developement agenda. The scatter-plot in this section shows increase in population having Sewerage Connection, over 20 years. The different dot sizes depict population of a country. As we hover over the graph, the **tooltip (cursor)** shows name of the country of a particular data point. **Single Selection** which acts as a dynamic query filter, enables user to click on any point and disaply its details on-demand in the form of a pie chart, alongside. The pie chart shows classification of Sewerage Infrastructure in Basic, imited-shared, Unimproved Sanition and Open defecation. It gives over-all idea of the country's sewerage infrastructure and availability of safely managed sewerage systems. Most of the countries show significant improvement in 20 years.
- **Section 3.2 Performance by Nations in Safe Collection and Disposal of Sanitary Wastewater from its Citizens:** SDGs aim to irradicate open defecation and provide safely managed sewerage infrastructure to the people. This section contains scatter plots showing **Treated Waste-Water** vs. **Safely Managed Sanitary System**. As their names suggest, these are interdependent and most of the countries show relative progress in these two parameters. The scatter-plot of **Treated Waste-Water** vs. **Open-defecation** shows that irradicating open-defecation is a slow yet continuously progresssing process. Waste-water can be treated only when it is connected to a sewer system, is collected and carried to a treatment plant. The third scatter plot in this section, **Treated Waste-Water** vs. **Sewer Connections** show almost direct relation for most of the countries. The different dot sizes depict population of a country. The **Slider** of Years, help dynamically compare the progress of different nations over the time. For most of the countries, the parameters in all the three graphs show clear relation.

## Development

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?
- The data is obtained from https://data.un.org/ as a CSV. The preliminary inspection and understanding the data was carried out in Microsoft Excel. However, the data cleaning (removing NA values, changing data types of variables as per the requirement, etc) and processing was done using Python.   

## Success Story

TODO:  **A success story of your project.** Describe an insight or discovery you gain with your application that relates to the goals of your project.

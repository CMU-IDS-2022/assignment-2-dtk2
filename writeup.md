United Nations has gloabally designed several Sustainable Developement Goals(SDGs) as actions to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure peace and prosperity for human beings. SDGs are the extensions of Millenium Developement Goals(MDGs), which were started in the year 2000 to serve the same purpose. SDG-6 is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This project analyzes overall developement of countries around the world, towards safely managing drinking water and sanitation. 

## Project Goals

This goals of this project are:
- To analyze different aspects and parameters that govern safety in drinking water and sanitation.
- To analyze developement in managing drinking water and sanitation in the worlds, over past 20 years.
- To isualize the population growth vs. developement over the period.


## Design

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?
-Section 1 World Population Growth: Population is an important and consistently growing parameter on which, developement largely depends. This section shows a pair of histograms depicting population growth in different countries and different SDG Regions in the the world between from the year 2000 to 2020. The slider provided to visualize the changes in population shows real-time comparison of the same, over the years.
-Section 2 Clean Water
-Section 2.1 Correlation between parameters: The data obtained has 10 different parameters. To visualize the correlation (connection) between these parameters, a correlation matrix is plotted. Many parameters show strong correlation among themselves. The SDG is to ensure clean drinking water, hence the most important parameter is 'Non Contaminated Water', which shows significantly high correlation with the 'Piped Water'. This indicates that as the piped water networks increase, the delivery of non-contaminated water increases. 
-Section 2.2  


 

## Development

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?
The data is obtained from https://data.un.org/ as a CSV. 

## Success Story

TODO:  **A success story of your project.** Describe an insight or discovery you gain with your application that relates to the goals of your project.
